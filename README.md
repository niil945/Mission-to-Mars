# Mission-to-Mars

## Project Overview

In this project we utilized BeautifulSoup to scrape data from multiple websites, locally the data was stored in a mongodb, created a locally hosted website using Flask, and then using Flask accessed and displayed data stored in mongodb to the hosted website. The site allowed the user to refresh the data manually via a button. Using Bootstrap 3 we customized the website to make it more mobile friendly and responsive.
